/// A protocol to be implemented by the application to receive all the supported callbacks from the Zebra Scanner SDK to inform the application about scanner related events
///
/// The SDK supports a set of asynchronous notifications to inform the application about scanner related events. This includes connectivity related events (i.e., appearance or diappearance of a scanner), and scanner action events (i.e., received barcode data). If an object is registered via ``symbolbt-sdk/ISbtSdkApi/sbtSetDelegate:`` as a notification receiver, the SDK calls the corresponding method of the registered object when a particular event occurs if the application is subscribed for events of this type using ``symbolbt-sdk/ISbtSdkApi/sbtSubsribeForEvents:`` .
@protocol ISbtSdkApiDelegate <NSObject>

/// Device arrival notification informs about appearance of a particular available scanner.
/// - Parameter availableScanner: Object representing an appeared available scanner
- (void)sbtEventScannerAppeared:(SbtScannerInfo*)availableScanner;

/// Device disappeared notification informs about disappearance of a particular available scanner.
/// - Parameter scannerID: Unique identifier of a disappeared available scanner assigned by SDK.

/// Barcode event notification informs about reception of a particular barcode of a particular type from a particular active scanner.
/// - Parameters:
///   - barcodeData: Object representing ASCII data of a scanned barcode
///   - barcodeType: Barcode type (Symbology type) of the scanned barcode
///   - scannerID: Unique identifier that assigned by SDK of a particular active scanner that barcode is scanned
